-- Used when we are dealing with a range in an array
-- Key Points to Identify Sliding Window Problems:
    These problems generally evolve around Finding Maximum / Minimum Subarray, Substrings which satisfy some specific condition.
    The size of the subarray or substring ‘K’ will be given or asked in some of the problems.
    These problem can easily be solved in O(n2) time complexity using nested loops, using sliding window we can solve these in O(n) Time Complexity.
    Required Time Complexity: O(n) or O(nlog(n))
    Constraints: n <= 106 , If n is the size of the Array / String.
