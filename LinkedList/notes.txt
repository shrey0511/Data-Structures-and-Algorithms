Doubly Linked List:
    A value , next and prev pointers
    
Circular Linked List:

-- Use find function in all of them to get to a certain node using value or index

-- Using recursion for insertion in LL
    void return type & make changes in LL
    Node return type that returns the list node to change the structure

-- Fast & Slow pointers:
    To be used with:
        Cycle detection
        Finding a node in a cycle etc.
