For left shift operator :
    for any b number of times that you shift ,value changes to : number * 2^b
- Always remember numbers are stored as 1 and 0 only in computers , so to use as
  binary just do '&' with 1
- For pascal's triangle in every row , the values goes with 2^(n-1):
    like for 3rd row , sum = 1 << (n-1) = 1 * 2^(n-1);
