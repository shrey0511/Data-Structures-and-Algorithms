-> If total ones is not divisible by 3 then equal split not possible
-> Keep in mind the case of all 0s where 1s in every part are 0 so use the 
    formula n*(n+1)/2...here n will be n-2 because if we take first 0 as split
    then n-1-1 term remain
-> Keep track of no. of ones if that crosses ones/3 then second split starts
