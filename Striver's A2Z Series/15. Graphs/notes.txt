Degrees in Graph : 
    For an undirected graph
        No. of edges connected to a node
        Total degree of a graph = 2 * no. of edges

    For a directed graph
        Outdegree : edges going out of that node
        Indegree : edges going inside a node

Edge Weight : 
    If not assigned assume 1 for all

Weighted graph:
    If the edges are weighted then in the adj. array we assign those weighted values
    Meanwhile for the arrayList: We store in pairs

If the components are not connected just use a visited array to complete traversal

DFS will require Recursion , BFS with queue
