## When to use?
-> If there is a sorted array
-> When we need to find a single solution following a certain pattern

## Ceiling of a number : Smallest no. >= target no.
## Floor of a number : Greatest no. <= target no.

## For 2D arrays -- 
-> As this is a large search space , always try to minimize it
