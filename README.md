# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms BootCamp! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. It is a valuable resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning about these fundamental concepts in computer science.
For gaining knowledge in DSA I have followed Kunal Kushwaha's DSA BootCamp. I am sharing the link for the playlist , do check it out.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is accompanied by explanations, time complexity, and space complexity analysis to help you understand the underlying concepts better.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrey0511/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
```

You can navigate through the directories to find implementations in different programming languages. Each directory contains a README file with specific instructions on how to run the code examples.
